            <strong>Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA)</strong>, is a genus of
            40[3] to 60 tropical and warm temperate flowering annuals and
            perennials from the family Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most
            species are native to Central America and Mexico but four are native
            to the United States.

            They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in.
            The opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The
            margins are slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact
            clusters.

            The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and
            spread in small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.
